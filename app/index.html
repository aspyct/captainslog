    <h1>Captain's Log</h1>
    <p>
        Captain's Log is an encrypted journal for whatever you want to log.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your username cannot be recovered from the files, and the log entries cannot be decrypted without your password.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="log.php">Access your log</a>. Use any user/password combination.
    </p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
        I wanted a simple way to log events like business car trips, refuels,
        but also more personal topics. I wanted to be able to use it from my
        computer or smartphone. A web application made sense, but I also
        like privacy and would not want any of this to become public.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus was born Captain's Log, a simple interface to keep an encrypted log.
    </p>
    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>
        Log entries are encrypted with AES-256-GCM, with a key derived from your password.
        Your log files are stored in a directory based on the sha512(username, password).
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a user "John Doe" with password "Oh My Password!" will have the following home directory:
    </p>
    <pre>e38fa17aaa4859ee8a4c7a37a09880a4753de681bbc24f6514b648412d967effd64e45e42615803a5f7dc05564bb1076e694e453d06523196536e1f68e111047</pre>
    <p>
        You can actually have multiple "John Doe" users in the system, as long as they have a different password.
    </p>
    <p>
        His log entries will be encrypted with a key derived from his password with pbkdf2. Here's a line of that log:
    </p>
    <pre>date                      pbkdf2 salt              pbkdf2 iterations  iv               gcm tag                  payload
2020-03-15T17:52:05+00:00,q9k+elfe5xxKmRrmN75lQQ==,30                ,KSf9ZRymxcFCtz4Q,hTsCn7ZJhp/az4RH9IMZYg==,eFNacVlBTHVKSVNQUjhjPQ==</pre>
    <p>
        To decrypt this payload, one would to know John's password, which is never stored on disk by the application. Of course, a good password is still required.
    </p>
    <h2>Use only with HTTPS</h2>
    <p>
        This application uses HTTP basic auth. This is both good and bad.
        Good because we are not storing your password on the server at anytime (except in RAM).
        Bad because this means your password is transmitted across internet every time you make a request.
    </p>
    <p>
        As long as you use HTTPS, this app should be relatively secure.
    </p>
